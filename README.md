# CircularRecyclerView
A subclass of RecyclerView that layout item views circularly, like an turntable phone...

This library is in a super pre-alpha state, assume stuff to crash / fail / not-working-as-expected.

![demo](https://github.com/Palatis/CircularRecyclerView/blob/master/demo.png)

# TBD
1. Fling doesn't work
2. SmoothScroll doesn't work
3. only layout counterclockwise...
